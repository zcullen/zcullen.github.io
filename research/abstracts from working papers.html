     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> Firms are allowed to use aggregate data on market salaries to set pay, a practice known as salary
benchmarking. Using national payroll data, we study firms that gain access to a tool that reveals market benchmarks for each job title. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the benchmark information reduces salary dispersion by 25%. Thus, salary dispersion must stem
partly from aggregate uncertainty about the salaries offered by other firms. Our model formalizes how salary dispersion can arise even in competitive labor markets for identical workers when such uncertainty exists, and we discuss implications for an ongoing policy debate.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> The diffusion of salary information has implications for labor markets, such as wage discrimination policies and collective bargaining. Access to salary information is believed
to be limited and unequal, but there is little direct evidence on the sources of
these information frictions. Social scientists have long conjectured that privacy norms
around salary (i.e., the ``salary taboo'') play an important role. We provide unique
evidence of this phenomenon based on a field experiment with 755 employees at a large
commercial bank in Southeast Asia. We show that many of its employees are both
unwilling to reveal their salaries to coworkers and reluctant to ask coworkers about
their salaries. These frictions persist, in smaller magnitude, when sharing less sensitive
information on seniority. We discuss implications for pay transparency policies and the
gender wage gap.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> Under the premise that transparency would strengthen unions' bargaining position, the U.S. National Labor Relations Act jointly legalized the right to unionize and to share salary information. In contrast with this intuition, we find that introducing transparency decreases support for collective action and, instead, increases support for individual negotiation as a more effective bargaining tool. The trade-off between individual bargaining and collective bargaining becomes starker when transparency reveals higher inequality. We derive these results from survey experiments with over 1,500 screenwriters and directors surveyed during the strikes of Summer 2023, as well as with a representative online sample of 2,000 U.S. respondents. In line with our empirical results, we propose a theoretical framework whereby pay secrecy sustains member participation in collective bargaining and generates higher union members' wage. This paper sheds light on the motives underlying union tactics, from pay secrecy to the negotiation of pay schedules and caps.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> Employers report labor shortages even among low skill jobs. Why don't wages adjust dynamically to clear market demand? Exploiting randomized variation in wages for 1% of job postings on a large staffing platform, we show that a 10% increase in wages would increase the fill rate by more than 30% for a wide range of employers. Despite this, we find that many firms do not raise wages even when vacancies remain unfilled. A firm-side RCT shows that firms have strong underlying demand for marketplace intermediaries to automatically raise wages for unfilled jobs. The gap between manual wage adjustments and chosen automated wage adjustments appears driven by employer uncertainty about the state of the labor market, and adjustment costs.
The RCT shows firms dynamically update their beliefs about the state of the labor market when vacancies go unfilled, but several parameters of the labor market shift simultaneously, generating conflation between labor shortages and mispricing. Our results suggest unfilled vacancies could fall by 20% with opt-in automated dynamic wages by marketplace intermediaries.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> U.S. residents and their representatives continue to demand limits to government data collection, restricting expansion of Census questions and curtailing data sharing between government agencies. Does this resistance stem from demand for privacy as a right, or fear of identifiable data use? We study individuals' resistance to the expanded 1940 U.S. Census---the first federal census to ask about income. We test how resistance responds to the changing personal stakes of a data leak, and shocks to its perceived likelihood.  An income data leak only differentiates individuals when they have unequal earnings.  We find that non-disclosure of income rises with inequality.  Inequality predicts non-disclosure rates better than political preferences, government spending, or religion.  Non-disclosure rises in response to quasi-random gaps in enumerator and respondent wealth.  We also exploit exposure to the unanticipated and short-lived circulation of personal tax returns fifteen years prior to the 1940 Census, finding such exposure also increases non-disclosure. We find that the patterns of resistance to government data collection are consistent with a fear of identifiable data use, they distort data inference, and downwardly bias measures of inequality.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> What happens when public resources are allocated by private companies, whose objectives may be imperfectly aligned with policy goals? We study this question in the context of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which relied on private banks to rapidly disburse aid to small businesses. Our model shows that delegation is optimal when delay is sufficiently costly, the variation of the impact of funds across firms is small, and the alignment between public and private objectives is high. We then use novel firm-level data to measure heterogeneity in the impact of PPP and to assess whether banks targeted loans to high-impact firms. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find that PPP loans increased businessâ€™s expected survival rates by approximately 10 to 20 percentage points and modestly boosted employment. While banks did target loans to their pre-existing customers, treatment effect heterogeneity is sufficiently moderate that delegation was likely a superior option compared to the high cost of delaying loans to improve targeting.

     <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> Drawing on surveys of small business owners and employees, we present four main findings about the evolution of remote work over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, nearly half of employers transitioned employees to remote work during the pandemic and a third continue to allow remote work.  Longer-term adoption tracks the Dingel and Neiman (2020) task-based measure of remote work suitability.  Second, businesses increasingly perceive remote work as productive. At the beginning of the pandemic, 70 percent of small business owners reported a productivity dip due to remote work, but these patterns reversed by early 2021, with the median owner reporting a positive productivity impact. Third, 12% of workers would accept a pay cut in excess of 10% to remain working from home but the majority would not accept lower pay, even in jobs deemed suitable for remote work. Finally, firms and workers both forecast that remote work will prevalent in the future.  Taken together, our evidence points to productivity gains and some workers' preferences as the reasons for the persistence of remote work.
