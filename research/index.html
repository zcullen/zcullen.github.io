	   <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> The public discourse around pay transparency has focused on the direct effect: how workers seek
to rectify newly-disclosed pay inequities through renegotiations. The question of how wagesetting and hiring practices of the firm respond in equilibrium has received less attention. To
study these outcomes, we build a model of bargaining under incomplete information and test our
predictions in the context of the U.S. private sector. Our model predicts that transparency reduces
the individual bargaining power of workers, leading to lower average wages. A key insight is that
employers credibly refuse to pay high wages to any one worker to avoid costly renegotiations
with others under transparency. In situations where workers do not have individual bargaining
power, such as under a collective bargaining agreement or in markets with posted wages, greater
transparency has a muted impact on average wages. We test these predictions by evaluating the
roll-out of U.S. state legislation protecting the right of workers to inquire about the salaries of
their coworkers. Consistent with our prediction, the laws lead wages to decline by approximately
2% overall, but declines are progressively smaller in occupations with higher unionization rates.
Our model provides a unified framework to analyze a wide range of transparency policies, and
reconciles effects of transparency mandates documented in a variety of countries and contexts.

<p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span>The vast majority of the pay inequality in an organization comes from differences
in pay between employees and their bosses. But are employees aware of these pay
disparities? Are employees demotivated by this inequality? To address these questions,
we conducted a natural field experiment with a sample of 2,060 employees from
a multibillion-dollar corporation in Southeast Asia. We make use of the firm’s administrative
records alongside survey data and information-provision experiments. First, we
document large misperceptions among employees about the salaries of their managers
and smaller but still significant misperceptions of the salaries of their peers. Second,
we show that these perceptions have a significant causal effect on the employees’ own
behavior. When they find out that their managers earn more than they thought, employees
work harder, on average. In contrast, employees do not work as hard when they
find out that their peers earn more. We provide suggestive evidence of the underlying
causal mechanisms, such as career concerns and social preferences. We conclude by
discussing the implications of pay inequality and pay transparency.

	   <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> The limited diffusion of salary information has implications for labor markets, such
as wage discrimination policies and collective bargaining. Access to salary information is believed to be limited and unequal, but there is little direct evidence on the sources of these information frictions. Social scientists have long conjectured that privacy norms around salary (i.e., the “salary taboo”) play an important role. We provide
unique evidence of this phenomenon based on a field experiment with 755 employees at a multibillion-dollar corporation. We provide revealed-preference evidence that
many employees are unwilling to reveal their salaries to coworkers and reluctant to ask
coworkers about their salaries. These frictions are still present, but smaller in magnitude, when sharing information that is less sensitive (seniority information). We discuss
implications for pay transparency policies and the gender wage gap.

	   <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span> Offices are social places. Employees and managers take coffee breaks together, go to lunch,
hang out over drinks, and talk about family and hobbies. In this study, we show that employees’ social interactions with their managers are advantageous for their careers and that this
phenomenon contributes to the gender pay gap. We use administrative and survey data from a
large financial institution. We estimate the impact of social interactions on career progression
using quasi-random variation induced by the rotation of managers, along with the smoking status of managers and employees. When male employees who smoke transition to male managers
who smoke, they take breaks with their managers more often and are subsequently promoted at
higher rates. The smoker-to-smoker advantage is not accompanied by any differences in effort
or performance. Moreover, we find that the male-to-male advantage is also only present among
employees who work in close proximity to their managers, limiting the mechanism to channels
requiring face-to-face interaction. The male-to-male advantage explains a third of the gender
gap in promotions at this firm.
